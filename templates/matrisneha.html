                The NeuroResonance Database has polyatomic time crystals or 3D clock
                assemblies representing almost all major organs, cellular components
                and even proteins. Natural map of 3D clock assemblies are foundation
                of its functional operation in a biological system. Therefore,
                polyatomic time crystal maps of the biomaterials provides an
                opportunity for us to design wide ranges of bio-inspired molecular
                machines that replicates nested biorhythms and assists in regenerating
                and correcting the protein regeneration cycles of the body.

            We plan to redefine medical science by direct, indirect and agent based
            interventions by developing rhythm engineering built therapeutics.
            Here are some of the fundamentals of the new medical science that we
            wish to develop.

            1. Chemical responses are not absolute as it exists in the medical science,
            it is part of different modes of interactions that govern the biological
            system. Therefore, a more efficient universal language is used to interact
            and negotiate with the biological system to govern its functioning in more
            holistic way.
