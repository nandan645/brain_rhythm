        <h2>Integrated Clock Architecture of the Whole Brain</h2>

        <p>
            We consider every component in the brain as a combination of dielectric
            resonators put inside a cavity resonator. The growth of such fused
            resonators starts from a single functional group inside secondary
            structures of proteins, DNA, etc., and grows within-and-above network,
            up to the entire biological scale.
        </p>

        <p>
            The database of rhythms or clock architectures has been created by the
            National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS), Japan. The database
            covers a complete integrated map of the whole brain and all components,
            design architecture, electromagnetic resonance properties, and their
            medical applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            The database aims to serve as a single complete source of all
            electromagnetic properties. We envision a resource platform for
            researchers, drug designers, medical practitioners and thus trigger a
            global research movement wherein using a geometric language future
            humanity would communicate with biosystems and correct errors, predict
            errors well in advance.
